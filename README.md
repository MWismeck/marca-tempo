## Digital Point Marker (Web App) - TCC

### **Project Overview**

This project is a **Digital Point Marker Web Application** developed as part of a final course project (TCC). The application is designed to streamline the process of tracking employee work hours using a modern, efficient, and user-friendly interface. The backend is built with **Golang (Go)** to ensure performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

The project aims to provide an intuitive experience for employers and administrators to manage employee records, track work schedules, and ensure compliance with labor regulations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface and interactivity)
- **Backend**: Golang (Go) (for API and business logic)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub (for code versioning and collaboration)

## üóÉÔ∏è **How the Application Works**

1. **Employee Registration**: Admins can create, view, update, and delete employee records via the web app.
2. **Digital Point Tracking**: Employees register their entry, break, and exit times through an intuitive web interface. If no times are provided, the system automatically populates them with the current date and time.
3. **Data Management**: All actions are processed through a secure RESTful API, with the backend handling all data validation and storage.
